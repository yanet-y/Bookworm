            <p id="aboutme"> Dear Bibliophile,<br>
                My name is Yanet, I am a software engineering student at AAIT and I………..drumrolls please………..am a bookworm, which is the main cause that led me to create this website. I started reading at six years of age, by that time I used to read princess stories, fairy tales, animal tales, and different children's books. I used to think my life was a fairy tale, I would ask my parents to buy me a princess dress and when they did I refused to take it off to the point of requesting to wear it as PJs (silly I know but what can I say I was a little girl immersed in all these princess stories and who was dreaming of being one) but then I grew up to be a teen when I started reading books about world facts, short real-life stories and a bunch of fictions. That's when I became addicted to books specifically fiction, some days I used to read until sun up. Reading isn’t just my hobby it’s my escape, I feel like I’m living a different life every time I read a book and there are millions of books to read in this world of ours but as James Joyce said Life is too short to read a bad book so we need to pick from the millions out there. With this in mind, I designed this website to share my opinions on some of my favorite romance, self-help, poetry, and auto-biography books and I hope to expand bookworm containing reviews of hundreds of books.
