I remember once I started reading it, there was no chance of getting any sleep since I couldn't put it down.It was such a lovely narrative filled a rollercoaster of emotions,there were some unexpected turns and twists in it It is unique but a bit of disclaimer here the story is a bit dark but that is where the uniqueness lies in, because like the saying "There is no rainbow wihout rain" the dark issues in the book makes us realize the beauty of love and the peace of healing but all in all while I adore all of colleen's writing this book ranks first for me.<br> Description of the book:Sometimes discovering the truth can leave you more hopeless than believing the lies.

            <p class="bookreview__romance--2">While I was reading the first few pages in this book,I thought it had a cliche story but when I went further I really loved it especially the main character of the book ,they had amazing chemistry and a healthy relationship which I think is nowadays rare in most romance fictions because some authors are promoting toxic relationships as something to crave for so I loved that aspect of the book.The story was focused on a love triangle ,it was immersive ,it will show you to what extent a person can go for the person they truly love and there was a beautiful mother-son connection in the book overall its amazing! must be read. <br> Description of the book:For years, I've dreamt of what college life could bring and while some things changed, there was always one constant.
                It didn't matter how wild I allowed my imagination to run, it always led me to the same place in the end.
                It led me to him.
                My future was clear, and he was it.
                Until suddenly, he wasn't.
                Now there's a new man in my life, one who isn't afraid to go after what he wants, and what he wants ... is me.
                They say first loves last forever.
                What about the second?
                This is a 152k word standalone romance that will have you swooning to the very last page! Enjoy!</p>

            <p class="bookreview__romance--3">This is a very unique and intriguing book with a mysterious,thrilling and amazing story.Never Never is about 18 year old Silas & 17 year old Charlie, forgetting who they are & everyone else in the process, in the middle of a school day.
What ensues is all about them finding out who they were in their 'past lives' and trying to find clues to the mystery of their missing memories. Ultimately getting to know each other all over again. They don't feel like themselves at all, but all they know is they only have each other.The book is a series consisting of 3 short books in which ever book ends with a huge cliffhanger,the only thing I would say I didnt enjoy about this series would be the book should have been a standalone instead of being a series.<br> Description of the book:Charlie Wynwood and Silas Nash have been best friends since they could walk. They've been in love since the age of fourteen. But as of this morning... they are complete strangers. Their first kiss, their first fight, the moment they fell in love... every memory has vanished.
Charlie and Silas must work together to uncover the truth about what happened to them and why. But the more they learn about the couple they used to be, the more they question why they were ever together to begin with. </p>
