                <p class="bookreview__nonfic--1">I Love My Love is a compilation of spoken word love poems written by a brilliant,inspiring author Reyna Biddy,which I admire the most although I didnt relate to the issues raised in this book because I havent experienced the situation she was talking about.But that didnt stop me from loving the book,her writing style was raw and moving its hard not to get affected by it. All I can say is it is a beautiful book packed with different emotions.<br>
                    Description of the book: Reyna Biddy's poems explore pain, emotional reckoning, and the power of self-love. The debut collection from 22-year-old poet Reyna Biddy, I Love My Love tells the story of Reyna's childhood, her parents toxic relationship, and how, against all odds, she learned to love herself.

                <p class="bookreview__nonfic--2">I first read this book when I was thirteen and at that age I didnt quite like it because it was hard for me to comprehend so I quit reading it but then when I was around 15 or 16 years old I saw a documentary about the Nazi and I remembered this book so I started reading it after years but this time was different,I literally couldn't stop reading it,I read it while I was eating,during bed time(until I fell asleep) to put it simply I was fully immersed in the story I felt like I was in the story,It felt like Anna was my friend and she was telling me her story.I would say this book taught me valuable lessons of life,It shaped my thinking and made me more mature,Anna is a legend that the world lost at such a young age.I feel proud that I have read this book and I'm able to speak my opinion towards it And I think people can learn a lot from Anna.100% must be read! <br>
                    Description of the book:Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit.
                    In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.
