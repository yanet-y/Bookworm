                <p class="bookreview__self--1">Atomic Habits is a kind of book that you read with deep focus,highlighting some points and rereading some lines you didnt understand to get the most out of the book.This book is the first self-help book I read and I learned a lot from it ,what I really loved about it was that the author's writing style was very clear,to the point and he used real-life examples to explain his ideas which made it interesting to read.I definitely think its the best guide for productivity,achieving your goals and working smart.<br>
                    Description of the book:Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.

                <img class="book2__cover" src="./image,icons and audio/mountain.jpg" alt="bookcover">
                <p class="bookreview__self--2">This book is the closest thing to going to therapy without actually going.It lets you figure out what is truly wrong with you by letting you to question yourself not by listing a bunch of statements telling you what to do,its really comforting and it feels like you are having a positive self-talk with your inner self.To be honest, the first few pages were hard to comprehend but it gets easier chapter by chapter.And I recommend this for people who are on a self-discovery journey but a bit of disclaimer here when you are reading the book keep in mind that the author is not a psychologist or anything of that sort she is just sharing what she learnt from life.<br>
                    Description of the book:This book is about self-sabotage.Why we do it, when we do it, and how to stop doing it—for good.
                    Coexisting but conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile. But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential.
                    For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome. To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the climb.
                    In the end, it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves.

                <p class="bookreview__self--3">I guess the title of this book gives you an idea of what the book is about,I would say it has a pretty self-explanatory title:).To read and get something out of this book you need to have an open mind,its served with a healthy dose of humor, loads of sarcasm and plenty of great quotes.The author wrote facts stated in many self-help books but what makes this book unique is that the author's sense of humor made it pleasing to read and easier for the information to sink in.Overall,its a good book <br>
