                    <p class="authors__about">Reyna Mays, known as “Reyna Biddy“, is a spoken word poet, author, and self-love enthusiast based in Los Angeles, California. Reyna is known for both her positive affirmations and poetry online. Her work welcomes in the lost, heals the broken, and gives hope to those who feel there's none left. Reyna's work is brutally honest, allowing you to experience her trauma, her childhood, her hurt, her healing process, and her journey toward self-fulfillment.
                    Reyna began her “self-love” journey in the beginning of 2015 and has gained popularity on almost every social site since. By maintaining a structured brand based solely around what it is and what it means to be a “strong loving vulnerable beautiful woman – inside and out” Reyna has accumulated a large variety of supporters. Reyna hopes to continue to grow with her audience as she grows within her art.
                    I first knew Reyna on her podcast called Unpack n Bounce back with her cousin skye, which is my favourite podcat of all time, they share their personal experiences and tough lessons learned while navigating through life.I learned many things from them,I would say they are my online mentors.I recommend you to check them out.In addition to that she has a strong intellect and knows what she is talking about.<br>
                    Below is a video of one of my favourite poems of hers:
